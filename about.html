          <p>
              I’ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices. Today, I’m working as a System Administrator for Utah Valley University, and I get to show off all these elements of who I am. I am also currently finishing a masters of Computer Science at UVU.
              I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. After a deployment with the Army, a college education in Criminal Justice, all the while continuing to pursue that hobby, I realized software engineering was the right field for me.
              Since then, I’ve worked on a number of freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of notable startups. Today, I’m hoping to work as a junior developer with an amazing team in Utah, and am getting into machine learning on my own time.
              I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, jQuery, and AngularJS, but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
