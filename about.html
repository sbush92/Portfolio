            I've always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert,
            and a tech geek obsessed with the latest devices. Currently, I am a
            proud graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Utah
            Valley University. I started coding as a teenager, turned a hobby
            into a career after a deployment with the Army. Experienced in
            various programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
            Python, jQuery, and AngularJS. Continuously expanding my skill set
            and exploring machine learning and AI in my free time.

            <a href="https://www.uvu.edu">Utah Valley University</a> Graduated
            May 2022
          </h6>
          <p>
            Thesis Title: "Real Time Sentiment Analysis with CUDA" Led a
            groundbreaking project where I delved into real-time sentiment
            analysis of streamed data, leveraging CUDA GPUs instead of CPUs.
            This venture served as a profound learning experience, allowing me
            to master GPU programming and general-purpose GPU programming with
            CUDA. My primary objectives included building a neural network for
            sentiment analysis, gaining insights into the field of sentiment
            analysis, and exploring the potential enhancements that CUDA could
            offer over CPUs. The project focused on the computational challenges
            of real-time sentiment analysis, particularly processing large
            volumes of data from sources like Twitter with quick turnaround
            times. Results highlighted CUDA's steep learning curve and its
            suitability for specific use cases rather than general-purpose
            programming. In conclusion, I recommend the use of PyTorch or
            TensorFlow for future implementations. Throughout this journey, I
            managed to craft a robust system, totaling 1200 lines of code, and
            tackled complexities involving asynchronous communication between
            two programming languages. This experience not only honed my skills
            in GPU programming but also provided valuable insights into the
            intricate nature of sentiment analysis with dynamic streaming data.
